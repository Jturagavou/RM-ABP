## If Features Are Not Showing

### Check These:
1. **Clean and rebuild** the project
2. **Check Xcode project** - all files should be included
3. **Check imports** - all necessary imports should be present
4. **Check navigation** - Groups tab should be visible

### Common Issues:
- **Missing Groups tab**: Check if ContentView.swift includes Groups tab
- **Timeline not working**: Check if GoalsView.swift has timeline sheet

- Cards are tappable (show chevron arrows)
- Tapping opens timeline view
- Timeline shows chronological history

- Multi-select member addition

## Next Steps if Issues Persist

1. **Check Xcode build errors** - look for compilation issues
2. **Verify file structure** - ensure all files are in correct locations
3. **Check dependencies** - ensure all imports are working
4. **Test incrementally** - test each feature separately

All features have been implemented and should be functional!
