# How to Run AreaBook in iOS Simulator

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

Since this is a remote environment without Xcode, you'll need to run the app on your local machine. Here's how:

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **macOS** (required for iOS development)
2. **Xcode 15.0+** (free from App Store)
3. **iOS 16.0+ Simulator** (included with Xcode)

## 🔧 Step 1: Download the Project

1. Download all files from this workspace to your local machine
2. Ensure you have the complete `AreaBook/` folder structure
3. Make sure you have the `AreaBook.xcodeproj` file

## 🛠️ Step 2: Set Up Firebase (Required)

### Option A: Quick Test Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# Create a temporary Firebase project for testing
# 1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
# 2. Create new project called "AreaBook-Test"
# 3. Add iOS app with bundle ID: com.areabook.app
# 4. Download GoogleService-Info.plist
# 5. Replace the template file in AreaBook/
```

### Option B: Use Template (Limited Functionality)
The project includes a template `GoogleService-Info.plist` that will allow the app to compile but won't have backend functionality.

## 🏃‍♂️ Step 3: Run in Simulator

### Method 1: Using Xcode (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Open Terminal
cd /path/to/your/downloaded/project

# 2. Open Xcode project
open AreaBook.xcodeproj

# 3. In Xcode:
#    - Select iPhone 15 Pro simulator (or any iOS 16+ device)
#    - Press Cmd+R or click the Play button
#    - Wait for build to complete
#    - App will launch in simulator
```

### Method 2: Command Line (Advanced)
```bash
# 1. Open Terminal
cd /path/to/your/downloaded/project

# 2. List available simulators
xcrun simctl list devices

# 3. Build and run
xcodebuild -project AreaBook.xcodeproj \
           -scheme AreaBook \
           -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15 Pro' \
           build

# 4. Install to simulator
xcrun simctl install booted ./build/Release-iphonesimulator/AreaBook.app

# 5. Launch app
xcrun simctl launch booted com.areabook.app
```

## 🎯 Step 4: Test the App

Once the app launches, you can test all the features we implemented:

### 1. Authentication
- **Sign Up**: Create a new account with email/password
- **Sign In**: Test login functionality
- **Password Reset**: Test forgot password feature

### 2. Core Features
- **Dashboard**: View KI progress and today's items
- **Goals**: Create goals with sticky notes
- **Tasks**: Add tasks and mark them complete
- **Calendar**: Add events and view calendar
- **Key Indicators**: Create and update KIs
- **Notes**: Create notes with markdown and linking

### 3. New Features We Added
- **Note Management**: Full CRUD with tagging and linking
- **Data Export**: Export your data to JSON
- **Feedback System**: Submit feedback (requires Firebase)
- **Help Content**: Comprehensive help documentation
- **Account Deletion**: Delete account with data cleanup

### 4. Progress Updates (Fixed)
- **Create a Task**: Link it to a goal or KI
- **Complete the Task**: Watch the progress automatically update
- **Create an Event**: Link it to a goal or KI
- **Complete the Event**: See automatic progress updates

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### 1. Build Errors
```bash
# Clean build folder
Product → Clean Build Folder (Cmd+Shift+K)

# Reset simulator
Device → Erase All Content and Settings
```

#### 2. Firebase Errors
```bash
# Error: "GoogleService-Info.plist not found"
# Solution: Make sure you've added the real Firebase config file

# Error: "Firebase not configured"
# Solution: Follow Firebase setup steps above
```

#### 3. Simulator Issues
```bash
# Simulator won't start
sudo xcode-select --install

# App crashes on launch
# Check Xcode console for error messages
```

## 📱 Expected Behavior

### Without Firebase Setup:
- ✅ App compiles and launches
- ✅ UI navigation works
- ❌ Authentication fails
- ❌ Data doesn't persist
- ❌ Real-time sync doesn't work

### With Firebase Setup:
- ✅ Full authentication
- ✅ Data persistence
- ✅ Real-time synchronization
- ✅ All features work perfectly

## 🎮 Demo Script

Here's a quick demo script to test the key features:

```bash
# 1. Launch app
# 2. Sign up with: test@example.com / password123
# 3. Create a Key Indicator: "Exercise" with target 7
# 4. Create a Goal: "Get Fit" and link to Exercise KI
# 5. Create a Task: "Go for a run" and link to the goal
# 6. Complete the task and watch progress update
# 7. Create a Note: "Workout log" and link to the goal
# 8. Export data to see all your information
# 9. Check Help section for detailed guidance
```

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Widget Testing
```bash
# 1. Run app in simulator
# 2. Go to iOS home screen
# 3. Long press to enter edit mode
# 4. Tap + to add widget
# 5. Search for "AreaBook"
# 6. Add widget to home screen
```

### Siri Shortcuts (iOS 16+)
```bash
# 1. Open Settings app in simulator
# 2. Go to Siri & Search
# 3. Enable "Listen for Hey Siri"
# 4. Try: "Hey Siri, add task to AreaBook"
```

## 📊 Performance Testing

### Memory Usage
- Monitor in Xcode: Product → Profile → Instruments
- Look for memory leaks or excessive usage

### Battery Impact
- Test widget updates
- Monitor background refresh

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test Core Functionality**: Verify all features work
2. **Test Progress Updates**: Confirm tasks/events update goals
3. **Test Widget**: Verify widget shows correct data
4. **Test Export**: Ensure data export works
5. **Test Help System**: Check all help content displays

## 📝 Feedback

After testing, you can:
1. Use the in-app feedback system (if Firebase is set up)
2. Create GitHub issues for any bugs found
3. Suggest improvements or new features
