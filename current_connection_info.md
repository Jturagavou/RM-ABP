# Current Agent Connection Information

## âœ… UPDATED CONNECTION DETAILS

**The IP address has changed! Use this new information:**

### Connection Details
- **Current IP**: `3.148.155.16`
- **Previous IP**: `3.12.82.200` (no longer valid)
- **Username**: `ubuntu`
- **Port**: `22` (SSH default)
- **SSH Key**: `cursor-agent-key.pem` (same key, still valid)

### Connection Commands
```bash
# Connect to agent
ssh -i cursor-agent-key.pem ubuntu@3.148.155.16

# Test connection
ssh -i cursor-agent-key.pem ubuntu@3.148.155.16 whoami
```

### SSH Status
- âœ… SSH Service: Running (PID 2666)
- âœ… SSH Keys: Configured and authorized
- âœ… Network: Instance is accessible
- âœ… Authentication: Working key pair

### Why the IP Changed
EC2 instances get new public IP addresses when:
- Instance is stopped and restarted
- Instance is rebooted in some cases
- AWS reassigns IPs for various reasons

### Solution for Future
To avoid IP changes, you can:
1. Use an Elastic IP (static IP)
2. Use DNS names instead of IPs
3. Always check current IP with: `curl -s ifconfig.me`

## ðŸš¨ Action Required
**Update your connection to use: `3.148.155.16`**

The SSH key you already have will work perfectly with the new IP!
