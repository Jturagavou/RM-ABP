# Google Calendar Day and Week View Research & Implementation Plan

## Research Summary: Google Calendar Features

### Core Day View Features
Based on research, Google Calendar's day view includes:

1. **Time-based Layout**
   - 24-hour time grid (typically 8 AM to 8 PM visible by default)
   - Hourly time slots with 15-minute sub-divisions
   - Current time indicator line
   - Scrollable timeline
   - All-day events section at the top

2. **Event Display**
   - Event blocks showing title, time, and duration
   - Color-coded events based on calendar/category
   - Truncated text with tooltips/popover details
   - Overlapping events handled with side-by-side layout
   - Visual duration representation (height = time duration)

3. **Interactions**
   - Click on time slots to create new events
   - Drag and drop events to move them
   - Resize events by dragging edges to change duration
   - Tap events to view details in popover
   - Quick edit mode for event titles

4. **Visual Design**
   - Material Design principles
   - Clear typography hierarchy
   - Subtle shadows and borders
   - Consistent spacing and padding
   - Accessible color contrasts

### Core Week View Features

1. **Grid Layout**
   - 7-column grid (Sunday to Saturday)
   - Same hourly time slots as day view
   - Compact event display with abbreviated titles
   - Cross-day event spanning
   - Weekend highlighting (optional)

2. **Navigation**
   - Week-by-week navigation
   - "Today" button to jump to current week
   - Month/year context indicators
   - Smooth transitions between weeks

3. **Event Management**
   - Multi-day event support
   - Event creation across days
   - Consistent visual treatment with day view
   - Responsive event sizing

### Key UX Patterns from Research

1. **Separation of View and Edit Tasks**
   - View-only popovers for quick event details
   - Separate edit mode for complex changes
   - Quick actions (delete, duplicate) in view mode

2. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Essential info visible, details on demand
   - Expandable sections for advanced features
   - Non-intrusive feature discovery

3. **Accessibility**
   - High contrast ratios
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Touch-friendly target sizes

## Current AreaBook Calendar Analysis

### Existing Features
- Basic date picker with graphical style
- Event list view for selected date
- Event cards with time, title, description, and category
- Event creation with recurring patterns
- Goal linking and task integration

### Gaps Identified
1. **Missing Day View**: No hourly time grid layout
2. **Missing Week View**: No multi-day overview
3. **Limited Interaction**: No drag-and-drop or resize capabilities
4. **Basic Event Display**: Only list format, no time-based visual representation
5. **No Time Slots**: Can't click on specific times to create events
6. **No Current Time Indicator**: No visual reference for "now"

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Enhanced Day View

#### 1.1 Create DayView Component
```swift
struct DayView: View {
    @State private var selectedDate: Date
    @State private var currentTime: Date = Date()
    @State private var scrollOffset: CGFloat = 0
    
    private let hourHeight: CGFloat = 60
    private let hours = Array(0...23)
    
    var body: some View {
        // Implementation details
    }
}
```

#### 1.2 Time Grid Implementation
- 24-hour vertical timeline
- Hourly slots with 15-minute subdivisions
- Scrollable view with proper content sizing
- Current time indicator with live updates

#### 1.3 Event Block Rendering
- Calculate event position based on start/end times
- Handle overlapping events with offset positioning
- Color-coded events based on category
- Truncated text with full details on tap

#### 1.4 Interactive Features
- Tap time slots to create events
- Tap events to show detail popover
- Long press for quick actions menu

### Phase 2: Enhanced Week View

#### 2.1 Create WeekView Component
```swift
struct WeekView: View {
    @State private var currentWeek: Date
    @State private var weekOffset: Int = 0
    
    private let dayWidth: CGFloat = 50
    private let hourHeight: CGFloat = 40
    
    var body: some View {
        // Implementation details
    }
}
```

#### 2.2 Week Grid Layout
- 7-column day grid
- Shared time axis with day view
- Compact event display
- Weekend highlighting

#### 2.3 Cross-Day Event Support
- Multi-day event spanning
- Event continuation indicators
- Proper event truncation/expansion

### Phase 3: Advanced Interactions

#### 3.1 Drag and Drop (Future Enhancement)
- Move events between time slots
- Move events between days (week view)
- Visual feedback during drag operations
- Conflict detection and resolution

#### 3.2 Event Resizing (Future Enhancement)
- Resize handles on event blocks
- Duration adjustment through dragging
- Snap-to-grid behavior
- Validation for minimum/maximum durations

### Phase 4: UI/UX Enhancements

#### 4.1 View Switcher
- Segmented control for Day/Week/Month views
- Smooth transitions between views
- Persistent view state

#### 4.2 Navigation Improvements
- Previous/Next navigation
- Today button with smooth scrolling
- Date picker integration
- Keyboard shortcuts support

#### 4.3 Event Details Popover
- Non-modal event details display
- Quick edit capabilities
- Action buttons (Edit, Delete, Duplicate)
- Goal and task integration display

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Structure Enhancements
The existing `CalendarEvent` model is well-suited for the implementation:
- `startTime` and `endTime` for positioning
- `category` for color coding
- `isRecurring` for recurring event handling
- `linkedGoalId` and `taskIds` for integrations

### Performance Considerations
1. **Lazy Loading**: Only render visible time slots and events
2. **Efficient Filtering**: Pre-filter events by date range
3. **Smooth Scrolling**: Optimize scroll performance with proper view recycling
4. **Caching**: Cache formatted time strings and calculated positions

### SwiftUI Implementation Strategy
1. **Custom Layout**: Use `GeometryReader` for precise positioning
2. **Scroll Coordination**: Synchronize scroll positions between views
3. **Gesture Handling**: Implement custom gestures for interactions
4. **State Management**: Use `@State` and `@StateObject` appropriately
