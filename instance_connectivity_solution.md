# Instance Connectivity Solution

## üéØ Current Situation Analysis

### Working Instance ‚úÖ
- **West Instance**: `35.93.148.203`
- **Status**: Working perfectly
- **Agents**: AWS Command Agent and Parallel Team ready
- **Recommendation**: **USE THIS ONE** for immediate productivity

### Problematic Instance ‚ùå
- **Current IP**: `3.149.191.121` (keeps changing!)
- **Previous IPs**: 
  - `3.148.155.16` 
  - `3.12.82.200`
- **Issue**: Not reachable from external networks

## üö® IMMEDIATE RECOMMENDATION

**Use the working west instance for now:**

```bash
ssh -i your-existing-key ubuntu@35.93.148.203
```

## üîß Why This Instance Isn't Reachable

### 1. Security Group Issues (Most Likely)
The security group probably has:
- SSH restricted to specific IP ranges
- No inbound rule for port 22 from 0.0.0.0/0
- Restrictions based on source security groups

### 2. Dynamic IP Problem
- This instance gets new IPs frequently
- Indicates it's being stopped/started regularly
- Not suitable for stable connections

### 3. Network Configuration
- May be in private subnet
- Network ACLs might be restrictive
- VPC routing issues

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Fix This Instance (If Needed)

### Check Security Groups (In AWS Console):
1. Go to EC2 ‚Üí Security Groups
2. Find security group for this instance
3. Add inbound rule:
   - **Type**: SSH
   - **Protocol**: TCP
   - **Port**: 22
   - **Source**: `0.0.0.0/0` (or your specific IP)

### Make IP Static:
1. Allocate Elastic IP in AWS
2. Associate with this instance
3. Use static IP for connections

### Test Current IP:
```bash
# Current connection attempt
ssh -i cursor-agent-key.pem ubuntu@3.149.191.121

# If it works, add to SSH config:
Host cursor-agent
    HostName 3.149.191.121
    User ubuntu
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/cursor-agent-key.pem
```

## üéØ PRACTICAL NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Recommended):
1. **Continue using west instance** (`35.93.148.203`)
2. **Start your agents there** - it's working perfectly
3. **Get productive immediately**

### Later (Optional):
1. Fix security group on this instance
2. Assign Elastic IP for stability
3. Test connectivity from your network

## üìã Connection Summary

### ‚úÖ WORKING NOW:
```bash
ssh -i your-key ubuntu@35.93.148.203
```

### ‚ùì TESTING (This Instance):
```bash
ssh -i cursor-agent-key.pem ubuntu@3.149.191.121
```

**Recommendation: Go with what works! Use 35.93.148.203 and troubleshoot this one later.**
