- **Actual Public IP**: `3.12.82.200`
- **IP you were trying**: `35.88.220.106` ‚ùå

## Root Cause
The timeout issue occurred because you were trying to connect to the wrong IP address (`35.88.220.106`). The correct public IP for this instance is `3.12.82.200`.

## Solution
Update your SSH connection to use the correct IP address:

```bash
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@3.12.82.200
```

## Additional Notes
- The instance appears to be running in a containerized or cloud environment
- SSH is properly configured and listening
- Host resolution issues exist (hostname "cursor" cannot be resolved)
- The system is running Ubuntu 25.04 (Plucky)

## Next Steps
1. Update your SSH client configuration to use IP `3.12.82.200`
2. Ensure your security group allows SSH (port 22) access from your IP
3. Verify you're using the correct SSH key pair

If you continue to have issues after using the correct IP, check your AWS security group settings to ensure port 22 is open for your source IP.
